These exercises are intended to demonstrate data analysis and programming skills learned from a graduate seminar on social statistics taken through the Department of Sociology at Duke University in the Spring 2025 academic year. Topics span probability; univariate statistics and inferences; bivariate statistics and inferences; general linear modeling (binomial, linear/Gaussian, Poisson regression); and model selection. To view the exercises, download the corresponding .html file and open it in your local browser. You can also run all of my R code contained in my .qmd files.
