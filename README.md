# Info 

These exercises are intended to demonstrate data analysis and programming skills learned from a graduate seminar on social statistics taken through the Department of Sociology at Duke University in the Spring 2025 academic year. Topics span probability (week3); univariate statistics and inferences (weeks4-6); bivariate statistics and inferences (weeks7-8); general linear (i.e., binomial, linear/Gaussian, Poisson regression) modeling (weeks9-13); and model selection (week13). Included also are a number of data visualizations, simulations, and mathematical expressions that are intended to make statistical concepts more intuitive. 

To view the exercises, download the corresponding .html file and open it in your local browser. You can also run all of my R code contained in my .qmd files. 

The data used for my analyses come from the [2022 General Social Survey (GSS)](https://gss.norc.org/).
